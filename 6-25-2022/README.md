# There are many different types of renewable energy:
- Solar energy from the sun.
- Geothermal energy from heat inside the earth.
- Wind energy.
- Biomass from plants.
- Hydropower from flowing water.

and as I thought about biomass, Maybe we can do different materials, like factory vents, can turn the smoke they create to energy

Energy efficiency is when it saves more energy for the same function

we can create a product that saves money. I think this is easier and it should be considered \n
like an efficient dog feeder or something random
