# second (analyzing the map)
This is the clearest view of the map:

### dimensions
it has two launch areas, we can figure out the dimensions because every year, the table stays the same.

we can recreate the base and measure it across, or use photoshop to copy the model or something.
### game pieces
The game piece is the energy/water containers

there are two different energy containers:
first there is the water with the string attached:

you need to hang the first one on high places.

the second is on the ground, you are maybe supposed to take it to the middle, look at the top photo. idk tho

## attachments we need.
we need pushing/pulling attachments, because many of the missions need a pull or push. We also might need a holder for the energy containers with string attached, because you need to lift it to high places. raising up, like a fast rack and pinion, will be needed for the electric car.

for this funnel thingy, we need a thing that can drop something into it, not shure what, just SOMETHING. 

we might need a claw or smth to release the cargo, because it might be classified as a hard mission, so it will be worth a lot of coins, like the sorting center in cargo connect

also, if you see this gif, for the tv mission, if you look behind the mission, the robot is also pulling the mission, so we probably need a pulling attachment. with the mission, you also get a energy canister, so that is useful.
