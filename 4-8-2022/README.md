# For Tomorrow
Need to do: 
### Color sensor
test color sensor: ambient light, accuracy. \
Also need to test how the color reacts in different situations, like with a high base or low base, in the light or shaded. \
We also need to work on gyro, see different measurements. 

### Line follow notes
shouldn't be too hard, python is very straightforward, so translating it from python should be no problem

### accel deccel
harder, but use math functions to translate.


## Notes about master program: 
there cannot be a master program, but like below, we can use the numbers to differentiate the mission runs, so it will be easier

Python is not that hard, but it needs a lot of getting used to, and logic, and familiarity of the functions and what do they do exactly
